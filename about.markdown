I'm Filippo Galli, a researcher in data science with a PhD from Scuola Normale 
Superiore di Pisa, Italy, where I focused on privacy-preserving machine learning. I've worked 
at Meta, CERN, and NASA, contributing to AI, robotics, and statistical privacy. 
I studied engineering in Torino, Italy, specializing in mechatronics and electrical 
systems. Outside of research, I played drums in a band - our 
music is still on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7x9tnv10Fj2tuNcPPnUq1J?si=h2t2oRjkTUira86DAkHUpA).
Whenever I can, I hike or ski in the Alps, and go to stand up comedy shows.

You can find me on [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/filippo-n-galli/).
