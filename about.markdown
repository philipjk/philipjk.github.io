I'm Filippo Galli, a researcher in data science with a PhD from Scuola Normale 
Superiore, where I focused on privacy-preserving machine learning. I've worked 
at Meta, CERN, and NASA, contributing to AI, robotics, and statistical privacy. 
I studied engineering in Torino, specializing in mechatronics and electrical 
systems. Outside of research, I played the cello and later drums in a bandâ€”our 
music is still on [Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7x9tnv10Fj2tuNcPPnUq1J?si=h2t2oRjkTUira86DAkHUpA).
Whenever I can, I hike or ski in the Alps, and go to stand up comedy shows.



<div style="text-align: justify">
Currently, I am employed by the Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna in Pisa, Italy, steering my career from robotics to artificial intelligence.

Whenever I get the change I hike up some mountains in the Alps or nearby. I watch a lot of YouTube.
