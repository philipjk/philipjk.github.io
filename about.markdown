This is my personal website. My name is Filippo Galli and I was born on July 23rd 1992 in Monza, Italy, just next to the city of Milan. 
I hold a B.Sc. in Electrical Engineering and a M.Sc. in Mechatronic Engineering, both from Politecnico di Torino, Italy.

I had the opportunity to intern in some incredible institutions:
* I spent six months on Erasmus (for people reading from outside Europe, it's an EU sponsored exchange program) at TUM Munich
* I worked on my thesis at NASA Jet Propulsion Laboratory as a Caltech visiting student for about six months
* I interned for one year at CERN as a Magnetic Measurement technical student.

<div style="text-align: justify">
Currently, I am employed by the Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna in Pisa, Italy, steering my career from robotics to artificial intelligence.

Whenever I get the change I hike up some mountains in the Alps or nearby. I watch a lot of YouTube.
