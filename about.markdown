My name is Filippo Galli, this is my personal website. I was born in the early 90's in Italy, just next to the city of Milan.
I studied engineering in Torino, Italy.
I used to play drums for some years, and cello before that.
You can listen to the music me and my band used to play on
[Spotify](https://open.spotify.com/artist/7x9tnv10Fj2tuNcPPnUq1J?si=h2t2oRjkTUira86DAkHUpA).



<div style="text-align: justify">
Currently, I am employed by the Scuola Superiore Sant'Anna in Pisa, Italy, steering my career from robotics to artificial intelligence.

Whenever I get the change I hike up some mountains in the Alps or nearby. I watch a lot of YouTube.
